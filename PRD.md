## Design Direction
The design should feel professional, trustworthy, and efficient - similar to enterprise tools like ServiceNow or Salesforce. Clean lines, purposeful hierarchy, and subtle interactions that feel responsive without being flashy. Minimal interface with generous whitespace serves the information-dense nature of supply chain data.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Using professional blue-gray as primary with warm amber accents for actions and alerts. This creates trust and urgency where needed.

- **Primary Color**: Deep blue-gray (oklch(0.25 0.02 250)) - Conveys professionalism and stability
- **Secondary Colors**: Light gray backgrounds (oklch(0.96 0.005 250)) for subtle content areas
- **Accent Color**: Warm amber (oklch(0.7 0.15 70)) for call-to-action buttons and important status indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Gray): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0.01 250)) - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue): White text (oklch(0.99 0 0)) - Ratio 12.8:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Amber): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0.01 250)) - Ratio 6.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey clarity and professionalism with excellent readability for data-heavy interfaces. Inter font family provides the clean, technical precision needed for enterprise applications.

  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height

## Animations
Animations should be subtle and functional, reinforcing the professional nature while providing clear feedback. Motion should feel precise and purposeful, never distracting from the work at hand.
