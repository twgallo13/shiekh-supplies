# ✨ Welcome to Your Spa## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.development.local` and configure your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.development.local
```

Key environment variables:

- `VITE_APP_ENV`: Application environment (development/production)
- `VITE_API_BASE`: Backend API base URL
- `VITE_TELEMETRY`: Enable/disable telemetry (on/off)
- `VITE_ENABLE_MOCKS`: Enable mock data for development

The app uses Vite's built-in environment variable system. All client-side variables must be prefixed with `VITE_`.
